						start with built-in Valorant accessibility + Windows color/zoom
						tools, then add safe external helpers (Overwolf apps, VibranceGUI,
						Borderless windowing). Avoid anything that injects into the game
						(e.g., ReShade) unless you’re comfortable with Vanguard risk — I’ve
						called those out below.

						<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-black">
							1. Valorant’s built-in accessibility & Enemy Highlight Color
							(first, always)
						</h2>
						<p class="mt-4">
							What it does — Valorant lets you change the enemy highlight color
							and has other accessibility toggles (HUD visibility, etc.). This
							alone often makes enemies and UI easier to see. How to use —
							Settings → General → Accessibility / Enemy Highlight Color. Use a
							bright, high-contrast color that stands out against maps (e.g.,
							neon cyan or bright magenta). Why this first — zero risk, works in
							every match, and is the fastest improvement.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section class="mt-2">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-black">
							2. Windows Magnifier (Lens / Docked modes)
						</h2>
						<p class="mt-4">
							What it does — system magnifier that can zoom a portion of the
							screen or dock a zoomed strip (works outside full-screen unless
							you run borderless/windowed). Great for reading UI, buy menu,
							scoreboard. How to use — Windows key + [+] to open Magnifier;
							switch modes in Settings → Accessibility → Magnifier. For best
							results play in borderless/windowed if full-screen blocks
							Magnifier.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section class="mt-2">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-black">
							3. Windows Color Filters & High-Contrast / Colorblind Options
						</h2>
						<p class="mt-4">
							What it does — system color filters
							(protanopia/deuteranopia/tritanopia), inverted colors or high
							contrast modes can make UI and target colors much clearer for some
							low-vision viewers. How to use — Settings → Accessibility → Color
							filters (Windows 10/11). Test filters on the HUD and agent/ability
							colors to find what helps.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section class="mt-2">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-black">
							4. Overwolf apps (approved overlays / trackers)
						</h2>
						<p class="mt-4">
							What it does — Overwolf hosts Riot-friendly apps (match tracker,
							HUD adjustments, stat overlays) that run with Valorant and are
							safer choices than unknown injectors. Some apps provide larger HUD
							elements, contrast data, and match info that can reduce eye
							strain. How to use — Install Overwolf → browse Valorant apps →
							pick apps like Valorant Tracker or Valofessor and configure
							overlays. Overwolf provides per-app control and is an official
							distribution for companion apps.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section class="mt-2">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-black">
							5. VibranceGUI (automates GPU vibrance/saturation)
						</h2>
						<p class="mt-4">
							What it does — raises digital vibrance (color saturation/contrast)
							outside the game by toggling the GPU driver setting when Valorant
							runs. This can make enemies, ability effects and UI pop more
							against backgrounds. How to use — Install VibranceGUI, add
							Valorant as a profile, tune vibrance to a comfortable level. It
							uses the driver API rather than injecting into the game. Many
							players find it helpful and it’s widely used.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section class="mt-2">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-black">
							6. NVIDIA Freestyle / AMD Radeon Image Filters (official driver
							filters)
						</h2>
						<p class="mt-4"
							>What it does — official real-time post-processing filters
							(contrast, brightness, color adjustments) provided by GPU vendor
							tools (GeForce Experience / Radeon). Good for boosting clarity
							without game injection. How to use — Enable Freestyle (GeForce
							Experience) or Radeon filters and apply per-game presets. Note:
							historically some game integrations changed — test on your
							setup.</p
						>
					</section>

					<section class="mt-2">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-black"
							>7. Borderless / Windowed-Fullscreen tools (Borderless Gaming or
							native mode)</h2
						>
						<p class="mt-4">
							What it does — lets you run Valorant windowed/borderless so
							Windows Magnifier, overlays and other assistive apps work more
							reliably. Borderless windowing can also let you move focus and use
							OS accessibility shortcuts without minimizing. How to use —
							Valorant settings → Display Mode → Windowed Fullscreen, or use
							Borderless Gaming to force borderless. Note trade-offs: windowed
							modes sometimes affect FPS/latency for some setups.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="mt-2">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-black"
							>8. ReShade (powerful but risky — read this before using)</h2
						>
						<p class="mt-4">
							What it does — ReShade injects post-processing shaders (magnifier
							shaders, edge detection/outline, contrast/brightness, custom zoom
							lens) that can dramatically help low-vision players (there are
							magnifier and outline shaders designed for visibility). Why the
							risk — Valorant uses Riot Vanguard (a strict anti-cheat). ReShade
							uses DLL injection and has historically caused bans or false
							positives in several Vanguard-protected games. Riot’s guidance is
							that third-party apps that alter gameplay visuals or inject into
							the game are subject to restrictions and risk. Recommendation:
							avoid ReShade while playing live Valorant ranked/competitive; use
							it offline or test carefully in unranked and accept the risk.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="mt-2">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-black"
							>9. ReShade magnifier & outline shaders (if you accept the
							anti-cheat risk)</h2
						>
						<p class="mt-4">
							What it does — community ReShade shaders can create a lens
							magnifier around your crosshair, add a high-contrast edge outline
							to models, or draw a thicker custom crosshair/target highlight.
							These are exactly the kind of visual mods low-vision players
							request. How to use — install ReShade → drop a magnifier.fx or
							outline shader into the game’s reshade-shaders folder → enable in
							the ReShade overlay and map hotkeys. Strong warning: ReShade may
							cause a Vanguard flag — link to Riot policy before suggesting it.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="mt-2">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-black"
							>10. Crosshair & UI tweaks, resolution/aspect hacks (4:3 stretched
							/ UI scale tricks)</h2
						>
						<p class="mt-4">
							What it does — changing crosshair color/size, using specific
							crosshair images, or running the game at different
							resolutions/aspect ratios (e.g., 4:3 stretched) can make UI
							elements and the crosshair proportionally larger on screen — often
							helpful for low-vision players. How to use — try larger crosshair
							thickness/opacity in Settings → Crosshair; experiment with
							resolutions/aspect ratios (some players prefer 4:3 stretched to
							make the UI/crosshair larger). Test to ensure clarity and input
							feel remain acceptable.
